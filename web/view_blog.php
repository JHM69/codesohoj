                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why Start with Competitive Programming?</h2>
                <p class="text-lg mb-6">Participating in competitive programming offers several advantages:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                    <li class="text-lg mb-2"><b>Improving Problem-Solving Skills:</b> Competitive programming exposes you to a wide range
                        of problem-solving scenarios. By tackling challenging problems, you will enhance your ability to analyze
                        complex tasks, break them down into smaller subproblems, and develop efficient solutions.</li>
                    <li class="text-lg mb-2"><b>Learning Efficient Algorithms and Data Structures:</b> Competitive programming encourages
                        the exploration and implementation of various algorithms and data structures. Through practice, you will
                        become familiar with fundamental concepts such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs,
                        and more. Additionally, you will gain insights into efficient sorting and searching algorithms.</li>
                    <li class="text-lg mb-2"><b>Enhancing Logical Thinking Abilities:</b> Competitive programming requires logical
                        thinking to devise algorithms and find optimal solutions. It trains your mind to think critically,
                        consider different approaches, and optimize code for efficiency.</li>
                    <li class="text-lg mb-2"><b>Gaining Exposure to Real-World Coding Scenarios:</b> Competitive programming exposes you
                        to real-world coding scenarios and challenges. You will encounter problems similar to those faced by
                        software engineers in the industry, allowing you to gain practical experience and apply theoretical
                        knowledge to solve practical problems.</li>
